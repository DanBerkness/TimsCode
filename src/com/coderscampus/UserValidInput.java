	/*
	// Directions

	// 1) Extending the functionality of Assignment #3

	// 2) Adding an additional field to User Object to include "role" add as well
	// username, password, and name.

	// 3) The role assignement to a User will be either: normal_user or super_user

	// 4) Based on the User's role (when successfully logged in) they will have
	// different actions they can perform.
	// (Hint: use Object Oriented principles (including inheritance) when designing
	// functionality). Remember has a vs is a
	// test that you can detect possible inheritance in your design.

	// 5) When logged in as a Normal User, you should be able to update any of the
	// fields that belong to this user instance
	// except the role
	// should be prompted with option to update username, password, or name

	// 6) User updates should output this information back to users.txt file and
	// make sure that the information is
	// properly sorted.

	// 7) When logged in as Super User you have same options as Normal User, have
	// ability to login as any other User
	// once switched to another User unable to switch back to SUPER user account

	// 8) Sort super users before normal users

	// 9) Sort usernames in alphabetical order(ascending order) smallest to the
	// largest
	
//	userService.getUserInfo(FileService.sortUsersFromFile("users.txt"));
	 * use switch case in user validate user role as normal user or super user
	 * update user input from user user login
	 * make sure user input is sorted corrected
	 * debug code for null pointer exception
